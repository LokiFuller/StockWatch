# StockWatch
This program is a simple interface that allows users to easily input a stock ticker and recieve the cooresponding stock prices for the past ten periods. Each period is color coded with green or red to display a gain or loss respectively. 

Additionally, there is optional functionality that allows users to see the Relative Strenth Index (RSI) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) for any stock.

Inspiration for this project comes from the lack of desktop applications that allow for viewing of stock prices without requiring a login and excessive boot up time.

## Features
- Retrieve and display stock prices for any stock symbol
- Calculate and display Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Calculate and display Simple Moving Average (SMA)

## Future Features
- Toggleable extensive interface that allows users to input multiple tickers at once
- Implementation of simple algorithmic trading methods such as the moving average crossover strategy
- Allow users to change the colors used in the program
